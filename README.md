<h1>Breast Cancer Classification Model</h1>
    <p>This repository contains code for a breast cancer classification model using machine learning techniques. The model is trained to predict whether a breast tumor is malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) based on input features.</p>
    
  <h2>Dataset</h2>
    <p>The model is trained on the popular Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset, which is publicly available and contains features computed from digitized images of breast mass. Each feature represents characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the images.</p>
    
  <h2>Model Architecture</h2>
  <p>The classification model is built using a machine learning algorithm, specifically LOGISTIC REGRESSION. The model architecture includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Data preprocessing and feature engineering to handle missing values, scale features, and encode categorical variables if necessary.</li>
        <li>Model training using the preprocessed data.</li>
        <li>Evaluation of model performance using relevant metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.</li>
        <li>Model deployment and inference to predict the class label of new breast tumor samples.</li>
    </ul>
    
   <h2>Installation</h2>
    <p>To run the code in this repository, you will need Python and several libraries. You can install the necessary dependencies using pip:</p>
    <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code>
    
  <h2>Usage</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Clone this repository:
            <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/Sankalp-Pattanayak/Breast-Cancer-Classification-Using-Machine-Learning.git
</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>Run the main script to train the model and evaluate its performance:
            <pre><code>python Breast Cancer Classification Using Machine Learning.ipynb</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>After training, you can use the trained model to make predictions on new data.</li>
    </ol>
    
  <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>The model achieves an accuracy score of 97% on the test dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in classifying breast tumors.</p>
